# Data Modelling with Postgres

This project creates a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, by creating a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. 


### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

These datasets have the following schema:
### Fact Table
    1. songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
    - songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
### Dimension Tables
    1. users - users in the app
    - user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
    2. songs - songs in music database
    - song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
    3. artists - artists in music database
    - artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
    4. time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
